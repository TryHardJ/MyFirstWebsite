# MyFirstWebsite

This was my first website I ever put together. This was also the first time I used javascript. I didn't expect the
project to be this big. At first, I only wanted to create a responsive one page website. After I did that, I decided to
practice php and mysql so I created a backend for the project. I wanted to learn how to create a web based painting
application so I added that to the project as well. There are two things I don't like about the project. The first, 
I think I created too many id tags in html and second, I used ID selectors in css. I'm going to make those changes 
but I decided to start on other projects because this was the only one I had in my portfolio at the time.
