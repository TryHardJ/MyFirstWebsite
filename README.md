# MyFirstWebsite

This was my first website I ever put together. This was also the first time I used javascript. I didn't expect the project to be this big. At first, I only wanted to create a responsive one page website. After I did that, I decided to practice php and mysql so I created a backend for the project. I wanted to learn how to create a web based painting application so I added that to the project as well. This project is still a work in progress.
